    Tree
    
    - In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract
    data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure,
    with a root value and subtrees of children with a 
    parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.
    
    - A tree should have only one root.
    
    - Another definition of tree is "tree is acyclic graph."

    means each node has at most two children, which are referred to as
    the left child and the right child.
    
    - Complete Binary Tree 
    means an "almost-full" binary tree, the right most nodes 
    of the bottom might be missing.
    
    - Full Binary Tree
    means a binary tree in which all leaf nodes have the same depth.
    
    - Max Heap 
    means a complete binary tree where the largest node is always the at
    root for any sub-trees.
